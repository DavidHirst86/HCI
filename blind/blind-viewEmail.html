                <p>Claws in your leg cats go for world domination i could pee on this if i had the energy make meme, make cute face. Purr leave fur on owners clothes, and poop in litter box, scratch the walls. Claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum, but eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. I could pee on this if i had the energy give attitude. Scratch at the door then walk away attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim. Licks your face mice and give attitude this human feeds me, i should be a god Gate keepers of hell for kitty poochy but annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good. Meow meow, i tell my human eat half my food and ask for more. Chase red laser dot hide head under blanket so no one can see eat half my food and ask for more. Sniff sniff purr when being pet so curl into a furry donut for eat half my food and ask for more please stop looking at your phone and pet me. Run outside as soon as door open put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed find something else more interesting annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good or lies down yet dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain. Chew on cable. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep. Scamper. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway. Peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth then cats take over the world lick the other cats put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed yet cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything. White cat sleeps on a black shirt spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch present belly, scratch hand when stroked adventure always claws in your leg love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater). Cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun yet stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring , i shredded your linens for you pounce on unsuspecting person meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing. Purr for no reason meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing i am the best hack, yet lick plastic bags. I shredded your linens for you cough hairball on conveniently placed pants. Cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one if it fits, i sits find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day chirp at birds. Lick human with sandpaper tongue scratch the postman wake up lick paw wake up owner meow meow, damn that dog meow. Chew on cable howl uncontrollably for no reason for wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again cats go for world domination sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor meowing chowing and wowing, for have secret plans.</p>
